## Wiring up the jelly baby

- Take two metal paper clips (or pins if you're using them) and unfold them to make a straight wire.

- Take a female-to-female jumper lead and push the paper clip wire into one of the ends.

- Do the same to the other wire, so that you have two identical jumper cables with paper clip wires in one end.

- Insert the paper clips into a jelly baby, so that they're close to each other but not touching.

- Now attach the free ends of the jumper leads to `GPIO 3` and any `GND` pin.
